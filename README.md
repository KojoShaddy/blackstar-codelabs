## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Navigation & Hash Routing**: Automatically synchronizes the URL hash (e.g. `#step-3`) with the step contents, supporting browser back/forward buttons and direct step linking.
- **Auto-Saving Progress**: Syncs checklist completions and active progress to `localStorage`. If users refresh, they will pick up right where they left off.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard Utility**: Integrated copy buttons on code blocks with quick visual "Copied!" feedback state.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Modern dark theme by default, toggles to light mode with a smooth visual transition.
- **Fluid Responsiveness**: Flexbox/Grid architecture that collapses the sidebar into an overlay drawer menu on mobile devices.
- **Celebration Confetti**: Embedded high-performance canvas particle system triggers once attendees finish the final step.
